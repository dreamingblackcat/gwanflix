# Welcome to Gwanflix Repo

This is a repository to follow along when participating in the workshop titled: "Working with databases and SQL" by Chan.

# Getting started

We will be starting out with a very clean slate. We only have this README.md currently.

First, we need to create a new empty database so that we can start running our SQL queries against it.

To create a database, right-click on the sidebar and create a new file or run the following command in terminal.

`touch gwanflix.db`
